1(a). DDL Commands:
Data Definition Language (DDL) - These SQL commands are used for creating, modifying, and dropping
the structure of database objects. The commands are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, and TRUNCATE.
A. Consider the database for a College. Write Queries to implement the following:
1. Create a database

	CREATE DATABASE college;

2. Select the current database
	USE college;
3. Create the following tables:
a. Student(roll_no,name,dob,address,phone_no,blood_grp)

	CREATE TABLE student(rollno int primary key,name varchar(20),dob date,house_name varchar(20),place varchar(20),phone_no varchar(20), blood_grp varchar(20));

b. Course(Course_id,Course_name, course_duration)

	CREATE TABLE course(course_id int primary key,course_name varchar(20),couse_duration varchar(20));

4. List all tables in the current database.

	SHOW TABLES;

5. Display the structure of the Student table.

	DESC student;

6. Drop the column blood_grp from Student table.

	ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN blood_grp;

7. Add a new column Adar_no to the table Student.
	
	ALTER TABLE student ADD COLUMN (Adar_no int(20));

8. Change the datatype of phone_no from varchar to int

	ALTER TABLE student MODIFY COLUMN phone_no int;

9. Drop the tables.

	DROP TABLE student;
	DROP TABLE course;

10. Delete the database.

	DROP DATABASE college;

B. Consider the database for an organization. Write Queries to implement the following:
1. Create a database

	CREATE DATABASE organization;

2. Select the current database
	
	USE organization;

3. Create the following tables:
a. Employee(emp_no,emp_name, DOB, address,mobile_no,dept_no,salary)

	CREATE TABLE Employee(emp_no int PRIMARY KEY,emp_name varchar(20),DOB date,address varchar(20), mobile_no int, dept_no int, salary int);

b. Department(dept_no,dept_name, location)

	CREATE TABLE Department (deptno int PRIMARY KEY,dept_name varchar(20),location varchar(20));
	
4. List all tables in the current database.
	
	SHOW TABLES;

5. Display the structure of the Employee table.

	DESC Employee;

6. Add a new column Designation to the table Employee.

	ALTER TABLE Employee ADD COLUMN (designation varchar(20));

7. Drop the column location from Department table.

	ALTER TABLE Department DROP COLUMN location;

8. Display the structure of the Employee table.

	DESC Employee;

1(b). Constraints
Constraints are used to make sure that the integrity of data is maintained in the database. Following are
the most used constraints that can be applied to a table.
• NOT NULL -restricts a column from having a NULL value
• UNIQUE -ensures that a field or column will only have unique values
• PRIMARY KEY -uniquely identifies each record in a database
• FOREIGN KEY -used to relate two tables
• CHECK -restrict the value of a column between a range
• DEFAULT -used to insert a default value into a column

Write queries to implement the following:

1. Create new table Person with attributes PersonID(with constraints NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY),
Name (constraints-NOT NULL),Adar(constraints-NOT NULL UNIQUE), Age (constraints
CHECK>18).
	
	CREATE TABLE Person(PersonID int Primary Key, Name varchar(20) NOT NULL,adar int NOT NULL UNIQUE, Age int, CHECK(Age>18));

2. CREATE TABLE Orders with attributes OrderID(with constraints-NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY),
OrderNumber(constraints-NOT NULL) and PersonID( set FOREIGN KEY on attribute PersonID
referencing the column PersonId of Person table)

	CREATE TABLE Orders(orderID int PRIMARY KEY,orderNumber int NOT NULL,PersonID int,FOREIGN KEY(PersonID) REFERENCES Person(PersonID));

3. Display the structure of Person tables.

	DESC Person;

4. Display the structure of Orders tables.

	DESC orders;

2(a). DML Commands:
Data Manipulation Language (DML) - These SQL commands are used for storing, retrieving, modifying,
and deleting data. These commands are: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
Consider the database for an organization. Write Queries to implement the following:
1. Add 5 rows into the table Employee and Department.

	INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(101,"John","1990-02-12","no152",1462137,1,10000,"professor"),
				(102,"Mathew","1982-06-21","no168",1421627,1,10000,"professor")
				(103,"Preethi","1990-04-05","no102",1234612,2,7000,"Clerk")
				(104,"Rahma","1995-11-11","no192",1241623,3,55000,"Manager")
				(105,"Anny","1979-04-11","no103",1469210,4,3000,"Peon");

	INSERT INTO Department VALUES(1,"MCA","Block C"),
					(1,"Mechanical","Block D"),
					(1,"Civil","Block A"),
					(1,"BArch","Block B"),
					(1,"EEE","Block F");

2. Display all the records from the above tables.

	SELECT * FROM Employee;
	SELECT * FROM Department;

3. Display the emp_no and name of employees from department no 2.

	SELECT emp_no,emp_name FROM Employee WHERE dept_no=2;

4. Display emp_no, emp_name ,designation,deptno and salary of employees in the descending
order of salary.

	SELECT emp_no,emp_name,dept_no,salary,designation FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC;

5. Display the emp_no ,name of employees whose salary is between 2000 and 5000

	SELECT emp_no,emp_name FROM Employee WHERE salary BETWEEN 2000 and 5000;

6. Display the designations without duplicate values.

	SELECT Designation FROM Employee GROUP BY designation;

7. Change the salary of employees to 45000 whose designation is 'Manager'

	UPDATE Employee set salary = 45000 WHERE designation="Manager";

8. Change the mobile number of employees named John

	UPDATE Employee set mobile_no= 9142327 WHERE name="John";

9. Delete all employees whose salary is equal to Rs.7000

	DELETE FROM Employee WHERE salary=7000;

10. Retrieve the name,mobile number of all employees whose name start with “A”

	SELECT emp_name,mobile_no FROM Employee WHERE emp_name LIKE "A%";

11. Retrieve the empno,name,salary of all employees working as peon and clerk.

	SELECT emp_no,emp_name,salary FROM Employee WHERE Designation = "Peon" OR Designation = "Clerk";
